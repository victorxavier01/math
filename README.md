## 🎯 About

The purpose of this repository is to:

✔ Strengthen mathematical intuition  
✔ Implement concepts from scratch  
✔ Apply theory to real datasets  
✔ Prepare for Machine Learning and AI projects  

Instead of only learning formulas, I focus on **understanding how and why things work**.

## 📖 Study Methodology

My learning process follows 4 steps:

1. Understand the theory  
2. Solve manually (paper & pencil)  
3. Implement in Python  
4. Apply to real data  

> Learning math without implementation is incomplete.  
> Learning code without math is fragile.
